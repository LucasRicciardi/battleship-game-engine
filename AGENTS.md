Phase 1 Complete (2026-06-19):
- research.md: Observability design with logging, tracing, metrics
- data-model.md: Core entities (Game, Board, Ship, Player, GameStats)
- contracts/api.md: HTTP API contracts for all endpoints
- quickstart.md: Validation scenarios and testing guide
- Dockerfile: Application container at project root
- docker-compose.yml: Infrastructure setup at project root

Phase 2 Pending:
- tasks.md: Implementation tasks (run /speckit.tasks)

Extension Hooks:
- Optional post-hook: speckit.agent-context.update (description: Refresh agent context after planning)

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **battleship-game-engine**. Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
